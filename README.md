# websitedemo
This is a book rating website demo which I made during the summer school in 2018. The website was realized by html5, css, PHP and javascript. The database was SQLite.
The demo was completed in June, 2018 and was updated in August, 2018.
This website enables you to view, insert, modify, delete a book.
Images used in this demo are compressed in the "images.zip" file.
